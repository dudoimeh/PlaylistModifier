# PlaylistModifier
This app takes in two spotify playlist IDs (p1, p2) and can either combine or subtract them. 

# Combining Playlists
Combining playlist combines both of them into p1. p1 will end up with all the songs from both p1 and p2, and p2 will be left unchanged and neither playlist will be deleted. 

# Subtracting Playlists
Subtracting playlists subtracts p2 from p1. p1 will end up with all of its original songs, except those that are in p2. p2 will be left unchanged and neither playlist will be deleted
